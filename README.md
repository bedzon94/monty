# 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

## In this project, we created a simple interpreter for Monty ByteCodes. The interpreter reads a bytecode file and executes the bytecode commands.

## Aim for this Project
What you should learn from this project:
Using Monty byte code file interpreter for stack and queue data structures

- What do LIFO and FIFO mean
- What is a stack, and when to use it
- What is a queue, and when to use it
- What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
- What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
- What is the proper way to use global variables
